# 🔐 Web-Based Caesar Cipher Encryption/Decryption Tool  

This is a **web-based text encryption/decryption tool** built with **Python (Flask)**.  
It allows users to **encrypt** or **decrypt text** using the Caesar Cipher with a customizable shift key.  


## 🚀 Features  
- Encrypt text with a shift key  
- Decrypt text with the same key  
- Session-based history of inputs and results  
- Input validation (to avoid errors)  
- Simple and clean web interface  


## 🖥️ How to Use

**🔑 Encryption**

1. Enter the text you want to encrypt.


2. Enter a shift key (number).


3. Click Encrypt.


4. Encrypted text will be displayed.



**✔ Example:**

Input: HELLO, Shift = 3

Output: KHOOR





**🔓 Decryption**

1. Enter the encrypted text.


2. Enter the same shift key used during encryption.


3. Click Decrypt.


4. Original text will be restored.



**✔ Example:**

Input: KHOOR, Shift = 3

Output: HELLO




## 📜 Session History

Each encryption/decryption is saved in the session history.

Helps track multiple results during one session.




## 🛠️ Tech Stack

Python (Flask) – Backend

HTML/CSS – Frontend




## 📖 Future Improvements

Add support for different cipher algorithms (e.g., Vigenère, AES demo)

User authentication to save history across sessions

Mobile-friendly UI with better styling
